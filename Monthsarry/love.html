                 Happy 1st monthsary, love💕I can’t believe it’s already been a month since
                 we started this journey together. It may seem short to some, but to me, 
                 this month has been full of moments I’ll always treasure your smiles, your 
                 words, your presence, and the way you make my days feel lighter and all of
                  them are because of you.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                 I still can’t believe that someday I would become your boyfriend. It was very 
                 unexpected, but I am so happy that God had a plan for us and brought us together.
                 I spent seven months courting you until you finally said your sweet “YES” on December
                  18, 2025. We surpassed many struggles and challenges, even though we are in a long 
                  distance relationship. We still chose each other and made it to this day.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                  This is only the beginning of our relationship, and I know our journey will not always 
                  be easy. There will be days when we feel tired, confused, or hurt. But even on those days, 
                  I hope we choose to stay strong and choose each other.</p><br>
            <p>
                 We need to keep understanding one another, to listen with our hearts, and to be patient even 
                 when things feel hard. Love is not only about happy moments, it is also about staying when things 
                 become difficult and choosing to fight for each other.</p><br>
            <p>
                 No matter what challenges come our way, I want us to hold on, grow together, and never give up
                 on what we have. Even on days when love feels heavy or unlovable, I will still choose you,
                  again and again.
            </p><br>

            <p>
                I know it is very hard for you to sacrifice your dream of becoming a Latin honor and to 
                become an irregular student now. I know how difficult this situation is for you, and I understand
                 how much it hurts. If you ever need help, please tell me, because I know I am part of the reason,
                  and I want to take responsibility. Thank you for choosing to stay close to me and for choosing us.
            </p><br>
            <p>I promise that I will never leave you or cheat on you. I am serious about my intentions because I 
                want to become your husband someday. I will do my best to love you, understand you, support you,
                 protect you, and care for you. I promise to always work on becoming the best version of myself, 
                 not only for me, but also for you and for our future.</p><br>
            
            <p>When you are in Manila, I always worry about you because it feels like bad luck keeps following you. 
                I know it is very hard for someone so young to experience so many difficult things in life. Even so, 
                you continue to stay strong, and that makes me admire you even more.</p><br>
            <p>
                Please remember that you are not alone. I am always here for you, through the good days and the hard 
                days. No matter what happens, I will stay by your side, hold your hand, and face everything with you, together.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                This is just the beginning of our story.
                I promise to choose you every day. 🌸
